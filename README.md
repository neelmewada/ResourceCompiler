# ResourceCompiler
A simple &amp; easy to use resource compiler for C/C++ using JSON.

## Usage

Compile the resources into .c & .h files using the following command:
```
ResourceCompiler.exe path/to/Resources.rc.json
```

Check the resources folder in the repo for more information on how to set up the resources and JSON files. Please note that all the .c & .h files inside the resources folder in repo are generated by the ResourceCompiler.

There should always be a resources.rc.json file in the path/to/resources folder. This file defines the structure of all the resources and sub-resources.

There's also a json schema file in this repo to use with an IDE for auto-complete and validation.
